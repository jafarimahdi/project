**** our team  *****

<p>
    We stand for equality in access to education. We believe in
    providing those who have experienced displacement with tools to
    foster inclusion and also to take part in national and societal
    debates about the terms of their inclusion. We are motivated by a
    sense that refugees and asylum seekers are subject to short term
    thinking about integration, as well as discourses and policies based
    on fear and impressions of security threats that have a negative
    impact on the welfare and migration projects of refugees and their
    families.
